############################### This is small demo application for consolidated Market books####################

Requriment : Build and serve consolidated market book for all Trading equities

Description:
Equities can be traded on multiple exchanges. You can subscribe to market data feed from each
exchange to track the book for a security. We want to build a consolidated book that merges the per-
exchange books.
There are two types of market feeds

1.       Top of the book. Each message from the exchange has SYMBOL, BEST_BID_PRICE,
BEST_BID_SIZE, BEST_OFFER_PRICE, BEST_OFFER_SIZE
2.       Order based book. Messages can be
a.       NEW_ORDER: SYMBOL, LIMIT_PRICE, SIDE (BUY/SELL), QUANTITY, ORDER_ID

b.       CANCEL_ORDER: ORDER_ID
c.       MODIFY_ORDER: ORDER_ID, NEW_QUANTITY (modifications allow changing the quantity
only)
Consume the market data feed (top-of-the-book style and order-based-book style) from multiple
exchanges, and build a consolidated book per symbol such that
Level 0: Bid Size, Bid Price, Offer Price, Offer Size
Level 1: Bid Size, Bid Price, Offer Price, Offer Size
…
Such that Level 0 is the BEST (highest Bid price, lowest offer price), Level 1 is the next best, and so on.
The Size at each level is the sum of the sizes at all the exchanges at that price.
Serve the top 5 levels of the consolidated book. There are many readers – all simultaneously requiring
the top 5 levels of the consolidated book by symbol.


Assumptions : While devloping this demo i have assumed that both incoming feeds will have comma separated data and feed format will be  text files.
